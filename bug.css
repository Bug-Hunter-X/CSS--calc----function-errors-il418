The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations with different units. However, if you use it incorrectly, you might encounter unexpected behavior. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` for a width can cause issues if the parent element doesn't have a defined width.  Another common mistake is forgetting to include spaces around the operators.  `calc(100%-10px)` will likely not work as expected.
