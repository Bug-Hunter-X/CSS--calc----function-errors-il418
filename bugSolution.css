The `calc()` function should always have spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /).  Ensure the parent element has a defined width if you're calculating a percentage-based width using `calc()`.  For example, instead of `calc(100%-10px)`, use `calc(100% - 10px)`.  Also ensure that all values within the calculation are valid CSS values.  Consider fallback values if the calculation might result in an invalid value.
